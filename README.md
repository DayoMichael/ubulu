## ⚡ Assumptions Made

- The app is intended for demo and learning purposes, not production.
- All data (users, blog posts) is stored in-memory (Zustand); no backend or persistence.
- The blog editor uses Tiptap and stores HTML; legacy posts may use Markdown.
- The UI is designed to be modern, animated, and responsive across devices.
- The codebase follows presentational/container and DRY principles for maintainability.
